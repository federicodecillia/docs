title: Background Agents
---

GPT Chatbot has 2 types of Agents:

    - **User-facing:** Agent directly interacts with users conversationally in a Q&A fashion.
    Only a single user-facing Agent engages with the user when a new query is input into the chatbot.

    - **Background:** Agent never interacts with users directly and instead monitors the conversation
    in an ongoing fashion. All background Agents are run whenever the user submits a new query to the chatbot.

Unlike user-facing Agents, background Agents are designed to monitor conversations and provide
assistance in the background by **assigning tags or calling functions** when certain criteria are met.

<Note>
  Agents are completely isolated from one another. This means that you cannot
  direct the behavior, bias, or selection priority of one Agent from inside
  another Agent.
</Note>

Background Agents are always run whenever the user submits a new query into the chatbot.
This enables you to create “multi-threaded” workflows that significantly improves the accuracy and
consistency of your chatbots. Instead of tasking a single Agent to coordinate among a multitude of
potentially independent and unrelated tasks, having multiple specialized Agents simultaneously
monitor the conversation and handle subsequent actions will yield much better results.

When configuring a background Agent, the prompt should be very simple and concise. Since background
Agents do not generate direct “conversational” output, your instructions should be restricted to variations of
“monitor the conversation for certain user behavior or intent”. You can instruct the background Agent
to set tags or call functions when the corresponding triggers are met.

In certain cases, you may still wish to enable RAG for background Agents (if you need to evaluate a
user's claim against certain policies or historical records before assigning a tag, for instance).
If this is true, you should give the Agent access to the necessary knowledge sources by going to the “Knowledge” tab in the Agent edit dialog.

A common user case for background Agents is conversation tagging. For an example of how to use background Agents to assign
conversation tags, see [Frustration Detection](/frustration-detection).
